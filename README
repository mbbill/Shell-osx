It's an OSX-like theme for gnome-shell, forked from Elementary theme which was designed by Sean Wilson.

Install:

# close this repo.
$git clone git://github.com/mbbill/Shell-osx.git

# install to local themes folder.
$cp -r ./Shell-osx ~/.themes

# switch to it in 'gnome-tweak-tool' -> 'Theme' -> 'Shell theme'
